### What is a Software Framework?

A Software Framework is a _strong set of rules and conventions enforced by a base software_ to help creating new software. 

> Let's say you are cooking meals using a kitchen robot. The kitchen robot has different operations to "weight", "slice", "mix" and "cook", as well as operations for "starting", "pausing", "opening" and "closing" the main container. Each operation has a set of parameters: when "slicing" you may specify the speed and type of cut, while in "cooking" you may specify the speed and temperature. You can say that this kitchen robot offers a _framework_ with which any meal creator can configure meals. This meal creators can combine, step-by-step, each operation and several ingredients to achieve a meal. While the kitchen robot restricts the operations and parameters to the ones it offers, and even forces a certain sequence of steps (you can only cook after the lid is closed), it streamlines recipe creation.

### What makes a Framework

* A Software framework facilitates creating software by providing a structure and action-flow of a program that program creators can configure to achieve their goals.
* More than just example code, a software framework dicatates the program flow, that is, the framework forces some actions to be executed automatically after the program executes some other actions. While it limits what can be done, it also gives the user a proven method to achieve basic needs and freeing the user to customize other parts of the program.
* A software framework includes one or several of the following:
    * libraries
    * APIs
    * pre-written code and programs
    * auxiliary tools like compilers (that turn higher-level code into lower-level code)
    * documentation and example

### Common Types of Frameworks

* Front-end frameworks. These are frameworks used to build "the visible" part of your application or website. They provide conventions to how you should load screens, design elements on those screens, handle events (like button presses) etc.
* Back-end frameworks. These are frameworks used to build "the central" part of your application or website. They provide conventions to how you should receive requests, route them, handle them etc.
* Full-stack framworks. These are framworks used to build the whole application or website, end-to-end (front-end and back-end).

### Examples of Frameworks

* When you use a modern website, the part of the website that is loaded on your browser (the Front-end) is built using a framework. React and Angular are 2 very common frame-works.
* Many web services use the Spring framework to build their back-end systems.
* Ruby on Rails (for Ruby), Django (for Python) are full-stack frameworks.
