### What makes an SDK

* An SDK is a bundle that typically includes all the things you need to develop a program.
* An SDK includes some or all of the following tools:
    * Frameworks
    * Libraries
    * APIs
    * Core tools like a compiler (that makes a software code executable) or a simulator/ emulator.
    * Other technical tools and programs to aid software development (bug finding, memory management, etc)
    * Examples in code and guides.
    * Frequently, an SDK will be bundled with an IDE (integrated development environement). An IDE is the application where you manipulate source code when you are building a program; you can also do other program creation related activities in an IDE, like debugging or version control. 
* SDKs can support multiple alternative coding languages.

### Common Types of SDKs

These are some anecdotal types of SDKs
* SDKs for native app development. These are the SDKs for developing for an iPhone, Android, mac etc.
* SDKs for web services development. XXX

### Examples of SDKs

* iOS SDK. This is the SDK that includes all the tools you need to build applications for Apple's iPhone. It supports multiple languages (Swift, Objective-C and others). It includes references and code for all the frameworks and APIs, Libraries and more. It comes bundled with XCode, Apple's IDE.
